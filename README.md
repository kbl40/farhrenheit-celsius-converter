## Temperature Converter
This is a quick program from the Rust book that will convert a user specified temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius.

From the terminal while in the root directory run:

`cargo run` 

Enter in a temperature (floating point or integer). The converted temperature will print out to the console.
